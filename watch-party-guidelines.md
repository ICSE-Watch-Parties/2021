title: How to plan and throw your watch party
---
Here you find guidelines and tips on how to plan a watch party at your institution or group ðŸ™‚

## Guidelines
Health and safety is an important topic in times of a global pandemic.
Especially large social gatherings over a longer time can be an accelerator to the spread of Covid19.
This is why ICSE 2021 is setting guidelines that we expect every watch party to adhere to in order to keep all watch party attendees safe.
Please make sure that your watch party will follow:

### Local Regulations
- Check rules of your municipality / government with respect to social gatherings and ensure that your event will adhere to them

### Max Number of Attendees
- Set a maximum number of attendees that your location can host
- Provide a contact for interested attendees to check if there are still places left

### Registration of Attendees
- Every attendee of a watch party should register beforehand
- Every attendee should also be a registered attendee of the ICSE 2021 conference

### Central Contact
- Every watch party should identify a contact person for questions from the ICSE 2021 organizers and the watch party attendees

<!-- ## Points to consider outside of the announcement template
- do you need any support staff for the watch party? -->

## Deadlines
If you plan to host a larger watch party open for attendees outside your direct circle, please announce it with at least partial information until **End of February 2021**.
This way potential attendees still have time to find your watch party and plan their conference week accordingly ðŸ™‚

## How to announce your watch party
Fill out the template to put your watch party on the list:
[Template to add YOUR watch party](watch-party-details/template-city-organization.md) 

1. Fork this repository
1. Duplicate the [template](watch-party-details/template-city-organization.md)  and name it reasonably (e.g. the scope of people you wish to invite, like the country)
2. Add a link to your watch party in the [master list](../watch-party-list.md).
3. Fill out the rest of the template :)
1. Open a pull request with your changes. We'll look over if you provided all necessary information and then merge it in so others can learn about your watch party!
