## Location
I'm throwing a small watch party in my living room together with two colleagues from my research group.

## Attendees
The living room is not very big so we're already at our full capacity :/ Hope to connect with you digitally at ICSE! 😊

## Time Bands / Parallel Sessions / Conference Days covered
We plan to watch the european sessions on all conference days. Which ones of the parallel sessions we will decide spontaneously.
In addition we want to attend MSR and ICPC 😄  

## Planned Social Events
Apart from the sessions we also want to join some of the social events 🙂
Also planning to play some AmongUs with friends from TU Eindhoven and cook together for lunches! 🥗🍔

## Pricing
-

## Catering
We cook together for lunch and Tomas is bringing snacks 😊

## Covid Concept
We expect that the measures are loosened in the Netherlands in May (to a similar level than May 2020) and therefore we can meet at my place. Still we have enough place to sit apart (that is why we will be only 3) and air out on both sides of the house 🙂

## Contact
As sadly no one else can join us physically I'll leave out my email here 🙃
