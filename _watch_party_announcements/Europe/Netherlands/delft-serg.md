Hey guys! We are the [Software Engineering Group (SERG)]{:target="_blank"} and we are planning the **ICSE 2021 Watch Party** at Delft University of Technology. Come and join us for the fun!

Since [ICSE 2021]{:target="_blank"} is going fully virtual, we are thinking of ways to make it still a memo-rabble event for everyone attending it from Delft. Thus we are planning a small gathering that will follow all the health and safety policies. You will not be able to attend ICSE in Madrid, but you will still have an exciting experience in the 2021 edition.

You will be able to watch your favorite talks of the conference with other like-minded students and researchers. We are also preparing panel discussion, social activities, and there will be real coffee breaks! Stay tuned!

## Location 🗺

**Delft, NL.** We are still looking out for places where to hold the watch party. If you have any ideas, let us know.

## Attendees 👩‍💻👩‍🚀🧛‍♂️

We are currently aiming at 30 people max. This number can change. We would be happy to have more people if the health and safety policies in place in May 2021 allow it. It may also happen that we have to reduce this number. Stay tuned for updates.

Instructions on how to register will be announced soon.

<!-- ## Time Bands / Parallel Sessions / Conference Days covered

Which conference days will your watch party cover?
At which time of day is your watch party → which conference time bands are you covering?
Are you providing rooms for all parallel sessions or just selected ones?   -->

## Planned Social Events 🎲🎸🎮

Of course ICSE is also about socializing and we want you to have the most out of it. 

We are currently brainstorming on how to make this watch party engaging.
We will organize
- local social events,
- events with other watch parties,
- events with the ones that could not make it to any watch party.

If you have any cool idea we are more than happy to hear about it. See [how to get involved](#how-to-get-involved).

<!-- ## Pricing
If attendees have to pay for participating at your watch party (e.g. for catering, lunch, coffee, snacks) please describe it in this section. -->

<!-- ## Catering
Please describe in this section whether there will be catering for the participants, such as lunch or dinner, coffee or snacks.
If you do not provide catering, you can use this section to inform participants that they have to bring their food or where there are restaurants around. -->

## Covid Concept 🦠

We will follow all the health and safety measures in accordance with Dutch government's advice. We will be in touch with the local authorities to make sure we follow all the regulations and everyone has a safe yet engaging experience at ICSE 2021. Along the way, we will provide more details.

For more information on the coronavirus measures at the university, checkout the special [TU Delft corona webpage]{:target="_blank"}.

## Cancellation policy

Due to the current health situation, we may have to scale down our event. In the worst-case scenario, we may have to cancel the event. We are optimistic that it will not be necessary, but we will keep you updated.
